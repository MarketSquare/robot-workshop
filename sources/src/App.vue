The library provides automation for various graphical testing objects.<br><br>The library was designed from needs of our own product; the need of automated testing (with RobotFramework) of the graphical application containing slots games and 10 interfaces. Due to the specifity of the application there is no other way to check the events than processing the screenshots.<br><br>The new Image Library's aim is to help automate UIs, inside the RobotFramework system avoiding integrating external tools and waiting for support.

These things are not that difficult to implement but a small paradigm shift might be needed. I have been working on techniques that would allow the simplest day-to-day test management decisions to be done by the testing pipeline itself. Such automation can be achieved using machine learning or even the simplest of algorithms.<br><br>While prototyping and trying to help others to leverage such algorithms and machine learning that would allow for e.g. automatic smart test prioritization and optimal resource usage, I have encountered a couple of obstacles that make the transition difficult or impossible for many teams. These are related on how the pipelines are used and how they are build. I would like to share with you how to get past these obstacles and make your testing pipeline ready for the next level of automation. Robot Framework is an excellent tool with many features that can help you get past these obstacles if you just know how to use it appropriately.<br><br>I will be sharing a very simple demo of a test prioritization algorithm that we have been working on to demonstrate these issues and possibilities of the algorithms.

To test full business processes from end to end we combine different tools and libraries and usually let our robots work the same way a user does. In this workshop, we will work together to script a flow through different interfaces and applications. We will introduce the way we are working with our customers, but instead of warehouse management and ERP systems, we will work with fun test flow through applications that anyone can access.<br><br>You should already be acquainted with working with RF. We will challenge you with a flow to script, but also provide a step-by-step solution suggestion so you can work in a pace that suits you. This is a fun workshop that we already have run variants of live, where it was a success. The ideal participant is someone who knows RF a bit, but have previously focused on testing one system or through one interface.<br><br>To accommodate different levels of users, we will provide the step-by-step solution from the start. That way, an advanced participant can move forward in their own pace, while less experienced participants can choose how much help to use to keep up. Since we are two hosts, we can cover all questions that arise. We also always have checkpoints where we make sure everyone has finished up to that point. Participants will need to bring their own computer, and have an installation of Python 3, and we will provide an installation package.<br><br><h3>At least basic knowledge of Robot Framework is recommended.</h3>",
