Robot Framework is a very powerful tool, but with great power comes with great responsibility. When working with several people in a large government organization on a test set without a clearly agreed structure, it is easy to get lost in a labyrinth of keywords. Structure is a must to keep a Robot Framework test set maintainable and can be achieved by a test automation framework architecture. <br><br>In this talk I will take you on a journey discovering and coaching the implementation of a multi-layer test automation architecture Robot rainbow cake. The ingredients include the application of known test automation strategies, writing BDD testcases and using the Page Object Model to automate on GUI level.

We call this industry the Open RPA Ecosystem.<br><br>RPA is a huge opportunity for the Robot Framework community, bigger than we can think of. Making the leap from test automation to automating anything is not just a technical challenge. It requires new ways of working, thinking, and organizing collaboration.<br><br>In this talk, we will outline what exactly is the Open RPA Ecosystem, and why do we need to start thinking in terms of an ecosystem instead of a single tool, Robot Framework. We will also take a look at what has happened in Open RPA since the last Robocon and what's expected for the next year.

Typically the specialists developing automation on RF are doing either (mostly) TA or RPA alone. Yet, there exists many benefits in combining these two. Answers to the following questions are given:<br><br>* Why should QA (or test automation developers) be the entity in your organization driving RPA development? <br>* The core differences between RPA and TA?<br>* Why you'll be most likely just fine with RF when doing RPA?<br>* Be the change.

These things are not that difficult to implement but a small paradigm shift might be needed. I have been working on techniques that would allow the simplest day-to-day test management decisions to be done by the testing pipeline itself. Such automation can be achieved using machine learning or even the simplest of algorithms.<br><br>While prototyping and trying to help others to leverage such algorithms and machine learning that would allow for e.g. automatic smart test prioritization and optimal resource usage, I have encountered a couple of obstacles that make the transition difficult or impossible for many teams. These are related on how the pipelines are used and how they are build. I would like to share with you how to get past these obstacles and make your testing pipeline ready for the next level of automation. Robot Framework is an excellent tool with many features that can help you get past these obstacles if you just know how to use it appropriately.<br><br>I will be sharing a very simple demo of a test prioritization algorithm that we have been working on to demonstrate these issues and possibilities of the algorithms.

If you are uncertain how to start integrating Robot Framework in your infrastructure or you would like to learn by example, this course is for you.<br><br>In this course, you will learn, how to:<br>1. Manage version from tests<br>2. Apply <b>clean test</b> rules<br>3. Manage test executions<br>4. Create reports from test results<br><br>Tools used in this workshop are: Jenkins, Gitlab, PostgreSQL, DbBot and RFlint. The tools themselves are not mandatory for achieving test management with open source tools. Learnings from this workhops can be applied to most of competitive tools.<br><br><h3>Recommended for beginners!</h3>",

                  description: "In this workshop you will learn how to extend Robot Framework using various different interfaces. The first half of the workshop is dedicated to the library API, starting from basics and quickly continuing to more advanced topics like the dynamic library interface (used nowadays by SeleniumLibrary) and automatic argument type conversion. During the second half you will get familiar with other extending and integration possibilities such as the listener API, modifying tests dynamically before execution, starting execution programmatically, analyzing results, and new parsing APIs in Robot Framework 3.2.",
                  descriptionExpanded: "This workshop is for you if you already know basics of using Robot Framework, preferably also basics of writing tests libraries, and want to take your skills to the next level. These skills make it easier to adapt the framework to your own needs in different contexts.<br><br>The workshop is 100% hands-on, no slides, learn-by-doing. In addition to learning from the person who has designed these powerful APIs, you have a change to ask hard questions related to Robot Framework from its creator.<br><br>Participants should know basics of Robot Framework, including test library API, and Python programming. Participants should bring their own laptop with Python 3.6 or newer and Robot Framework 3.2 or newer installed. They should also have adequate admin rights to install possible additional Python modules using pip. A text editor or an IDE for writing Python code and Robot Framework tests is needed as well.<br><br><h3>Recommended for advanced users.</h3><h3>Max number of participants: 16</h3>",

Sprints are for you if you want to contribute to some existing project in Robot Framework ecosystem, have a project or project idea you'd like to work with others, or just want to meet with other Robot Framework users and developers. We'll also have sauna afterwards!<br><br>Developers will select tasks suitable for new contributors beforehand (typically labeled with <code>good new issue</code> or <code>help wanted</code> in their issue trackers), but participants can obviously select issues they’d like to work with themselves. Many of the tasks are likely to involve coding, but there certainly are also non-coding tasks like testing, documentation and work with infrastructure like CI.</p> <p>If you are new to contributing to open source, we recommend you to take a look at the <a target='blank' href='https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/'>How to Contribute to Open Source</a> guide. Individual projects typically also have their own contribution guidelines you can find via their project pages and may want to study beforehand.<br><br>Sprints are free of charge and open for everyone, including those not participating the conference itself. Sprint facilities are provided by Eficode. The address is <a target='blank' href='https://goo.gl/maps/YoeBPqtGyGo'>Pohjoinen Rautatiekatu 25</a>. Food and drinks will be available.</p></div>"
