Sprints are for you if you want to contribute to some existing project in Robot Framework ecosystem, have a project or project idea you'd like to work with others, or just want to meet with other Robot Framework users and developers. We'll also have sauna afterwards!<br><br>Developers will select tasks suitable for new contributors beforehand (typically labeled with <code>good new issue</code> or <code>help wanted</code> in their issue trackers), but participants can obviously select issues they’d like to work with themselves. Many of the tasks are likely to involve coding, but there certainly are also non-coding tasks like testing, documentation and work with infrastructure like CI.</p> <p>If you are new to contributing to open source, we recommend you to take a look at the <a target='blank' href='https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/'>How to Contribute to Open Source</a> guide. Individual projects typically also have their own contribution guidelines you can find via their project pages and may want to study beforehand.<br><br>Sprints are free of charge and open for everyone, including those not participating the conference itself. Sprint facilities are provided by Eficode. The address is <a target='blank' href='https://goo.gl/maps/YoeBPqtGyGo'>Pohjoinen Rautatiekatu 25</a>. Food and drinks will be available.</p></div>"
